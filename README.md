**Data Engineer in Progress | BI & Data Engineer | SQL & Analytics enthusiast**

This is my journey to become a data engineer. Welcome to my Data Engineering journey!

I’m a Peruvian Informatics Engineering junior transitioning into a fully cloud-based Data Engineering role. I specialize in SQL, Business Intelligence, and analytical problem-solving, and I’m currently building production-ready data pipelines using Python and modern cloud technologies, while learning them on the way.

## Objective

Land a remote Data Engineering role in USD within 12 months.
This repository documents my 6-month transformation process as I level up from strong BI & SQL foundations to Cloud Data Engineering, to achieve personal dreams.

## Current skills

- SQL (Advanced)
- Power BI (Advanced)
- Python for Data analysis (intermediate)
- Data cleaning & transformation (intermediate)
- Dimensional modeling (in progress)
- Cloud fundamentals (AWS – in progress)

## What I’m building

This repository contains hands-on projects focused on:

- API data extraction
- Data cleaning and transformation with Python
- SQL-based data modeling
- Cloud storage and processing (AWS)
- End-to-end data pipelines
- Business-oriented dashboards

All projects are built with practical, real-world scenarios in mind.

## Public docs
I am documenting this journey publicly as a way to stay accountable and share insights about transitioning into Data Engineering from Latin America.

Follow the process:
- GitHub commits (daily progress)
- Project-based learning
- Cloud migration experiments
- Real-world freelance challenges

## Importance

I want to become internationally competitive, via building the following:

- Production-level projects
- Recruiter-ready portfolio
- Real cloud experience
- Communication skills in English
